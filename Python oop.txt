class definitions cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a class definition with no content
class Person:
  pass

built-in method called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

p1 = Person("Emil", 36)

print(p1.name)
print(p1.age)

The __init__() method is used to assign values to object properties, or to perform operations that are necessary when the object is being created.
