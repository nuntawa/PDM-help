class MyClass:
  x = 5

p1 = MyClass()
print(p1.x)


***Delete the p1 object:
del p1

#create object instant from class
p1 = MyClass()
p2 = MyClass()
p3 = MyClass()

print(p1.x)
print(p2.x)
print(p3.x)


class definitions cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a class definition with no content
class Person:
  pass

built-in method called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

p1 = Person("Emil", 36)

print(p1.name)
print(p1.age)

The __init__() method is used to assign values to object properties, or to perform operations that are necessary when the object is being created.
The __init__() method is called automatically every time the class is being used to create a new object.

class Person:
  pass

p1 = Person()
p1.name = "Tobias"
p1.age = 25

print(p1.name)
print(p1.age)
Without the __init__() method, you would need to set properties manually for each object:

class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

p1 = Person("Linus", 28)

print(p1.name)
print(p1.age)
With __init__(), you can set initial values when creating the object:


The self parameter must be the first parameter of any method in the class.
The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class.

class Person:
  def __init__(self, name):
    self.name = name

  def printname(self):
    print(self.name)

p1 = Person("Tobias")
p2 = Person("Linus")

p1.printname()
p2.printname()

It does not have to be named self, you can call it whatever you like, but it has to be the first parameter of any method in the class:
class Person:
  def __init__(myobject, name, age):
    myobject.name = name
    myobject.age = age

  def greet(abc):
    print("Hello, my name is " + abc.name)

p1 = Person("Emil", 36)
p1.greet()


Call one method from another method using self:
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name):
    self.name = name

  def greet(self):
    return "Hello, " + self.name

  def welcome(self):
    message = self.greet()
    print(message + "! Welcome to our website.")

p1 = Person("Tobias")
p1.welcome()
